You only need to run `rgb-master.ahk`

By default:

`F1` toggles the gui

`F2` toggles the rgb border. You can only toggle the border if one has been applied before-hand.



I have no intentions of maintaining this. I just thought it would be a cool idea to explore while learning. Therefore it is not littered with comments explaining everything as well as possible.

The only real issue I know of is that sometimes one or more rgb sliders will have the background color show up when clicking a different mode even though the random box is selected (which is supposed to hide the slider colors). There was no pattern of why this was happening. I could never get it to do it intentionally. I suspect it's an ahk or Windows issue. Or maybe I'm just not very perceptive :)
